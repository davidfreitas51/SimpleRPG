# Simple RPG Project

Welcome to the Simple RPG project! This project is designed for practicing C# object-oriented programming (OOP), clean code principles, and Git skills. The game allows you to easily create new attacks and enemies with minimal code changes, avoiding repetition and promoting code modularity.

## Features

- **Modularity:** Easily create new attacks and enemies with just one or two lines of code.
- **Avoids Code Repetition:** Promotes clean code by eliminating redundancy in attack and enemy implementations.
